## Business Objective
Churn quantifies the number of customers who have unsubscribed or canceled their service contract. Customers turning their back to your service or product are no fun for any business. It is very expensive to win them back once lost, not even thinking that they will not do the best word to mouth marketing if unsatisfied.

The basic layer for predicting future customer churn is data from the past. We look at data from customers that already have churned (response) and their characteristics / behaviour (predictors) before the churn happened.

In our case the objective is reducing customer churn by identifying potential churn candidates beforehand, and take proactive actions to make them stay.

## Dataset
The dataset has been obtained from kaggle.  [Link:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakash50897/churn-modellingcsv)

## Conclusion
We finally got 84.25% as accuracy using ANN.
